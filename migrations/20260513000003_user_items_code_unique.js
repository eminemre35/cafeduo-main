/**
 * Enforce UNIQUE constraint on user_items.code.
 *
 * Each coupon redemption should produce a per-user, per-purchase unique
 * code (a `CD-XXXXXXXXXXXX` random string). Without a DB-level guard, a
 * collision in the random generator OR a duplicate INSERT from a bug
 * could silently let two users hold the same code — the cafe-admin
 * scanner endpoint (commerceHandlers.useCoupon) would then redeem
 * whichever row UPDATE happened to match first.
 *
 * Two things this migration does:
 *   1. Removes legacy duplicate codes (left over from the old
 *      storeController hardcoded codes like RANK_NEON_SWORD). We keep
 *      the earliest-redeemed copy and orphan the rest by suffixing
 *      `-LEGACY-<id>` so the UNIQUE INDEX creation doesn't fail.
 *   2. Adds the UNIQUE INDEX so future INSERTs cannot collide.
 *
 * Idempotent: re-running the migration is safe.
