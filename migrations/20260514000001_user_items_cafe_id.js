/**
 * Tag every redeemed coupon with the cafe it was bought at.
 *
 * Until now user_items.cafe_id didn't exist — coupons floated free of
 * any cafe association. That meant cafe-admin A could scan a coupon
 * minted at cafe B and the validator would accept it (the useCoupon
 * query only checked `code`, no `cafe_id` filter). This migration adds
 * the column and a composite index so the validator can cheaply
 * filter by cafe.
 *
 * Existing rows get NULL — they were redeemed before the cafe-aware
 * flow existed and we have no historical record of which cafe they
 * belong to. The new useCoupon path treats NULL as "wildcard" (any
 * cafe-admin can still redeem legacy codes) so we don't break old
 * coupons retroactively; future inserts must populate cafe_id.
