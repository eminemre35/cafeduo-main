## Notes
- Some old OpenGameArt slugs can return `404`; this is usually a slug change, not always missing content.
- Prefer CC0 packs for frictionless commercial use.
- Keep `public/assets/games/ATTRIBUTION.md` synchronized whenever files are added or replaced.
- Itch reference checked: `https://lht-hhh.itch.io/gizmo-pixel-art-monster`
- That page allows commercial use but forbids redistributing standalone files; therefore it is reviewed as style reference, not vendored into this public repo.
